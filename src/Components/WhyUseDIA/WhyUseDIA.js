        Ever regret <em>not</em> doing something? Well, now's the time to step
        up.
        <span className="why-span" />
        Do It Already allows you to set bucket list goals so you can accomplish
        them one by one.
        <span className="why-span" />
        Set bucket list todos — like running your first 5k or visiting the
        Eiffel Tower — and cross them off as you achieve them!
