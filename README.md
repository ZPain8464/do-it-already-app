## Summary

Do It Already is a todo list app with the goal of empowering users to achieve their bucket list one by one. The app allows users to cross off bucket list todos as they accomplish them.

Bucket list todos are divided into four main categories:

1. Productivity
2. Finance
3. Fitness
4. Travel

After a user creates a bucket list todo, they can find it in the "Pending Todos" column on their "Bucket List Todos" dashboard.

Once they've marked a todo complete, it moves to the "Completed Todos" column so they can view their accomplishments over time.

Both Pending and Completed Todos are visible on the "Bucket List Todos"
dashboard if a user clicks on them. This will open up the todo so the user can see when it was created; it's also where users can update/edit their todos and delete them if necessary.
